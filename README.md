# Operating_Systems_Banker-s_Algorithm_Implementation
This program implements the Banker's Algorithm to determine if a system is in a safe state or not. Based on the provided resource allocation data, the program computes the safety state and, if safe, prints a possible execution sequence. If unsafe, it notifies the user of the system's unsafe state.
